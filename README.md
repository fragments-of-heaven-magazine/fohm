Hi, my name is Erin. I don't feel like I have a lot of strengths but I am pretty ok with git and also writing html files. I understand basic css for styling but have problems with media views. I am also able to step back to be more of a follower or step up to be more of a leader. 

Hello, mi nombre es Antoine and I don't speak spanish. I am pretty good at HTML and I understand CSS, though my skills aren't the greatest. I've done JavaScipt before, but currently my memory is wiped. However, anything you need me to do, I am willing to learn and will work my hardest to do whatever needs to be done for the sake of the group. PS: HIVE MiND Rules

Bonjour! Je ma'appelle Ore. My strenghts for this class include basic knowledge in HTML/CSS. I am pretty familiar with git and need more knowledge in JavaScript. I'm open to learning new things. Go HIVE MINDS!
